there are three sub-folders in this repository: 
Python coding samples in Visual Studio(data analysis and ML)
R coding samples in R-studio(data analysis and ML)
and data visualization from both!

no file is a full project and therefore is not producable. I have removed loading packages and datasets. each subfolder however, has a readME file that redirects you to the original complete project in case you wanted to see the whole process.
